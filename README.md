# King-s-Knightmare

This is a modified chess scenario. There is a modified chessboard with size n Ã— m. On the chessboard is a white king, a black knight, and several obstacles. Once the game starts, the knight can make a possibly infinite number of moves, and the king does not move. The goal is to write a program in Java that __finds a path for the knight to capture the king, while avoiding all obstacles.__
